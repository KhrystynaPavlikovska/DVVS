Project for 'IT in business and education' course

:computer: :books:
This is my first Git project designed to create my own repository, edit the README.md file and other ones, create and solve any conflict and cooperation with other users. 

In this folder there is a .txt file named 'Unique Elements In Unsorted Array', using which we can find count of unique elements in unsorted array in ะก++ programming language. In this file, we announce and initialize the array. Then we go through all the elements and look for the largest element. And using comparisons with maximum and other elements, we count the number of unique elements.
